# JS-Clock
A simple JavaScript clock that uses bootstrap
---
For this project you will need the following:
1. Code Editor(optional)
2. Browser
3. Bootstrap

So the main part is the js here in which we are setting Interval of 1 second and at every second the clock updates making it realistic and the bootstrap adds a very nice look in he clock 
This just gets the day, hour, minute, date of the specific moment and the time interval updates it..
